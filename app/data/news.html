    There's a certain amount of foolish ambition woven into just about every piece of material A Love Like Pi has released, and this new website has been no exception.

    When in the studio, we operate within a comfortable space. The tools we use to create are familiar. There is a cadence to the process that we've developed over time: write, pace, pace, play, listen, pace, pace, repeat.

    Leaving that world behind to express Jack and the Giant through art and code was like shaving with ice water. Every step in the process felt strange and unfamiliar. It was painfully slow. We made mistakes.

    Ultimately though, the challenge to visually capture some of the themes from the EP tested our creativity in a unique and exciting way. It gave us an opportunity to draw inspiration from areas that might've normally gone untapped. Most importantly, we're happy and proud to be able to share the result with you.

  <p>
    We'll be updating the experience with little touches here and there so be sure to check back intermittently, and as always, thank you for listening and participating.
